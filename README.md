# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Regression-Analysis-
This project analyzes the diamonds dataset to uncover patterns influencing diamond prices through regression analysis. Using 54,000 entries and various characteristics, we implemented and compared seven regression models, including Linear, Decision Tree, and Neural Networks, to identify the most effective predictor of diamond prices.
